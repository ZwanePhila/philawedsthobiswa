			<p>Our aim is to help your planning be as seamlessly as possible by providing you with the following:</p>
			<h2>Budgeting & Booking Vendors</h2>
			
			<p class="para-2">The first step of planning a wedding is setting your budget and finding the right vendors for your big day.
			Start by researching vendors in your area and comparing their services, prices, and availability. Once you have a general idea
			of what you want and how much it will cost, it’s time to start booking your vendors. Make sure to book early so that all the 
			details are finalized with plenty of time before the big day.</p>
			<br>
\
			
			<h2>Finding Your Perfect Venue</h2>
			<p class="para-2">Now that you have your budget and vendors set, it’s time to find the perfect venue for your special day. 
			Consider what type of atmosphere you want to create and research venues that fit with your vision. Be sure to check out
			each venue in person before making any decisions so you can get a feel for the space.</p>
			<br>
			<h2 >Establish Your Priorities and Expectations as a Couple</h2>
			<p class="para-2">When it comes to planning a wedding, there are countless decisions to be made and often times
			couples have different wants and needs. Establishing your priorities and expectations as a couple is an important
			step in the planning process so that you both feel equally satisfied when everything comes together on the big day.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Find Your Wedding Vision</h2>
			<p class="para-2">Finding your wedding vision is the fun part! Start by imagining what you want your wedding to look,
			feel and sound like. Use this as a stepping stone for all the other decisions you will make in the planning process. 
			From the dress to the decorations, make sure everything matches with your overall vision for your day.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Put Together Your Wedding Team</h2>
			<p class="para-2">No one can plan a wedding on their own – you’ll need an amazing team of people to help you along the way!
			Make sure to enlist help from family and friends that will be able to provide support for the big day. You may also want to 
			consider hiring a professional wedding planner or coordinator who can help keep things organized and moving forward.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>The wedding planning timeline</h2>
			<p class="para-2">This varies from couple to couple, but it’s important to plan ahead and stay organized throughout the entire process.
			With the right planning and a bit of patience, you can plan your dream wedding from start to finish!</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Wedding decor and themes</h2>
			<p class="para-2">Now comes the fun part – styling your wedding to match your vision! Choose a theme or color palette that will form the 
			basis for all of your decorations. Select centerpieces, lighting, and table settings that reflect your style and bring out all 
			the details you envisioned for your big day.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Food and drink for your wedding</h2>
			<p class="para-2">Food and drink are essential elements of any wedding! When it comes to selecting your menu, think about which dishes 
			will best suit your guests’ palettes and dietary restrictions. Consider whether you want to have a sit-down meal, buffet, or something in between. 
			Don’t forget to select appropriate beverages for your celebration too – this could include everything from signature cocktails to non-alcoholic options.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Finding the right music and entertainment</h2>
			<p class="para-2">Having great music and entertainment at your wedding is sure to make it a night to remember! Start by researching different bands or DJs
			in your area that can provide the perfect soundtrack for your special day. You might also consider having additional
			types of entertainment such as magicians, fire dancers, or a photo booth for your guests.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Photography and videography for your wedding</h2>
			<p class="para-2">Capturing all of the special moments from your wedding day is a must! Research different photographers or 
			videographers in your area and find one that fits within both your budget and vision. Once you have chosen someone, 
			book them as soon as possible to secure their services for the big day.</p>
			<br>
			<h2> Wedding invitations and save the dates</h2>
			<p class="para-2">You’ll want to send out your invitations and save-the-dates several months in advance. 
			Consider selecting a style that matches the overall theme of your wedding, then provide your guests with 
			all the necessary information they need to know.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Getting wedding attire and accessories</h2>
			<p class="para-2">Once you’ve selected your dress, it’s time to choose the perfect accessories. Think about what
			jewellery will match with your gown and complement your overall look. You can also select veils, headpieces,
			and other items that fit within your wedding style.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Finalizing Details & Rehearsal</h2>
			<p class="para-2">The months leading up to the big day will be spent finalizing details, such as decor, menu selection, seating arrangements, music, etc. 
			Make sure to communicate clearly with your vendors to ensure everything is in order before the day of the wedding.
			<br>
			The week of the wedding, have a rehearsal dinner for all your close family and friends to get everyone excited for the big day. 
			Then it’s time to relax and enjoy yourself as you count down the days until your special day!</p>
			<br>
			<h2> Enjoy Your Wedding Day</h2>
			<p class="para-2">Your wedding day has finally arrived! All your hard work and preparation has paid off and now it’s time to enjoy the moment. 
			Take a few moments throughout the day to take in all the special details and appreciate every moment.
			<br>
			At the end of the night, thank everyone who helped make your special day come together. From your vendors and
			family to your friends and guests, they all played a part in making your dream wedding come true.</p>
